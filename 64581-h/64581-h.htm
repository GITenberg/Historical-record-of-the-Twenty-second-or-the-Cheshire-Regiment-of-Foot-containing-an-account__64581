<p class="p2 noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
long a period, being undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under his Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General's Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore:" and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
our fellow citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar's favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar's legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were "<em>men-at-arms</em>," and sixty "<em>shot</em>;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers; half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral's regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
"grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
similar to those at present in use were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral's
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years' War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years' war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government
These achievements, with others of recent
dates in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
arms.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world, where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to insure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

that determined bravery which is inherent in Britons; but His Majesty
desires it may be most solemnly and forcibly impressed on the consideration

<p>In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards

no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves; and the enemy has been taught,
that whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not
how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure
victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p class="noindent">The accession of King William III. and Queen Mary, in
February, 1689, was welcomed in England with anticipations
of security to the civil and religious institutions
of the country, and of prosperity in every branch of
national industry; but in Ireland the majority of the
people adhered to the interests of the Stuart dynasty, and
a body of troops was raised in England, for the deliverance
of that country from the power of King James, who had
landed there with an armament from France. On this
occasion <span class="smcap">Henry, Duke of Norfolk</span>, evinced zeal for the
principles of the Revolution, and raised a regiment of
pikemen and musketeers, to which a company of grenadiers
was attached; and the corps raised under the auspices of
his Grace now bears the title of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>,
or the <span class="allsmcap">CHESHIRE REGIMENT OF FOOT</span>.</p>

<p>Having been speedily completed in numbers, equipped,
and disciplined, the regiment was encamped near Chester
in the early part of August, and soon afterwards embarked
for Ireland, with the forces commanded by Marshal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Duke Schomberg. On landing in Ireland, the siege of
<em>Carrickfergus</em> was commenced, and the garrison of that
fortress was forced to surrender in a few days.</p>

<p>From Carrickfergus, the regiment marched with the
army to Dundalk, where the troops were encamped on
low and wet ground, and suffered much in their health.</p>

<p>While the regiment was encamped at Dundalk, the
Duke of Norfolk was succeeded in the colonelcy by Sir
Henry Bellasis, who had commanded the Sixth regiment
of foot when it was in the Dutch service.</p>

<p>On the 7th of November the regiment commenced its
march from Dundalk for Armagh, for winter-quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>In the summer of 1690, the regiment had the honour to
serve at the battle of the <em>Boyne</em>, under the eye of its
Sovereign, who commanded the army in Ireland in person;
and on this occasion it took part in forcing the passage of
the river, and in gaining a decisive victory over the army
of King James on the 1st of July.</p>

<p>Advancing from the field of battle towards Dublin,
the regiment was reviewed by King William at Finglass,
on the 8th of July, and mustered six hundred and twenty-eight
rank and file under arms. It was afterwards
detached, under Lieut.-General Douglas, against Athlone;
but that fortress was found better provided for a siege
than had been expected, and the regiment rejoined the
army.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> was one of the corps employed at
the siege of <em>Limerick</em>. Many things combined to prevent
the capture of that fortress until the following year, and
when the siege was raised, the regiment proceeded into
winter-quarters, from whence it sent out detachments,
which had several rencounters with bands of armed
peasantry, called Rapparees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>On the 6th of June, 1691, the regiment joined the army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
commanded by Lieut.-General De Ghinkel (afterwards
Earl of Athlone) on its march for <em>Ballymore</em>, which fortress
was speedily forced to surrender.</p>

<p>From Ballymore, the regiment marched to <em>Athlone</em>, and
had the honour to take part in the siege of that fortress,
which was captured by storm on the 1st of July. The
grenadier company of the regiment formed part of the
storming party, which forded the river Shannon under a
heavy fire, and carried the works with great gallantry.
The capture of Athlone is one of the many splendid
achievements which have exalted the reputation of the
British arms, and its reduction proved a presage of additional
triumphs.</p>

<p>Astonished and confounded by the capture of Athlone,
General St. Ruth retreated, with the French and Irish
army under his orders, to a position at <em>Aghrim</em>, where he
was attacked on the 12th of July. On this occasion, the
regiment formed part of the brigade commanded by its
Colonel, Brigadier-General Sir Henry Bellasis, and it
contributed towards the complete overthrow of the army
of King James, which was driven from the field with
severe loss, including its commander, General St. Ruth,
who was killed by a cannon-ball.</p>

<p>The regiment had one Ensign and two private soldiers
killed; one Major, and twenty-three soldiers wounded.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July the army approached <em>Galway</em>;
after sunset six regiments of foot and four squadrons of
horse and dragoons passed the river by pontoons, and on
the following morning they captured some outworks. On
the 21st the garrison surrendered. Brigadier-General
Sir Henry Bellasis was nominated Governor of Galway,
and he took possession of the town with the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
and two other regiments of foot.</p>

<p>The surrender of Galway was followed by the siege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
and capitulation of <em>Limerick</em>, which city was surrendered
in September, and completed the deliverance of Ireland
from the power of King James.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692<br />1695</div>

<p>After the reduction of Ireland, the regiment was employed
in garrison and other duties of home-service,
until 1695, when it proceeded to the Netherlands, to
reinforce the army commanded by King William III.,
who was engaged in war for the preservation of the
liberties of Europe against the power of Louis XIV. of
France. After landing at Ostend, the regiment was
placed in garrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>Some advantages had been gained over the French
arms; to counteract which, Louis XIV. attempted to
weaken the confederates by forming plans for causing
England to become the theatre of civil war. With this
view the Duke of Berwick and several other officers in
the French service were sent to England in disguise, to
instigate the adherents of King James to take arms; a
plot was also formed for the assassination of King William,
and a French army marched to the coast to be in readiness
to embark for England. Under these circumstances
the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment and a number of other
corps were ordered to return to England, where they
arrived in March, 1696, and the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> landed
at Gravesend. The conspirators for the assassination of
King William were discovered; several persons were
apprehended, the British fleet was sent to blockade the
French ports, and the designs of Louis XIV. were frustrated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>In the following year a treaty of peace was concluded
at Ryswick, and the British Monarch saw his efforts for
the civil and religious liberties of Europe attended with
success.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1698<br />1700</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment was afterwards sent to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
Ireland, where it was stationed during the remainder of the
reign of King William III.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1701</div>

<p>On the 28th of June, 1701, the colonelcy of the regiment
was conferred on Brigadier-General William
Selwyn, in succession to Lieut.-General Sir Henry Bellasis,
who was removed to the Second foot, then styled
the Queen Dowager's regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>King William died in March, 1702, and was succeeded
by Queen Anne, who declared war against France.
Brigadier-General Selwyn was nominated Governor of
Jamaica, and promoted to the rank of Major-General on
the 10th of June, 1702. The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment
was ordered to proceed to Jamaica, and several other
corps also embarked for stations in the West Indies: the
British government designing to make a general attack
on the possessions of France and Spain in South America.</p>

<p>Major-General Selwyn died at Jamaica, and was succeeded
in the colonelcy of the regiment by the Lieut.-Colonel,
Thomas Handasyd, by commission dated the 20th
of June, 1702.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>A considerable body of troops arrived in the West
Indies in 1703: but they were afterwards recalled to take
part in the war in Europe. The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment
was left at the island of Jamaica, and during the
reign of Queen Anne the regiment was employed in
protecting Jamaica, and the other British settlements in
the West Indies, which important duty it performed with
reputation.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1704<br />1705</div>

<p>While employed on this duty, the regiment received
drafts from several other corps, and in 1705 an augmentation
of two companies was made to its establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>Colonel Handasyd was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General
in December, 1705, and to that of Major-General
in January, 1710. In 1712 he retired from the colonelcy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
resigning his commission in favour of his son, Lieut.-Colonel
Roger Handasyd, of the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713<br />1714</div>

<p>In the following year the treaty of Utrecht gave peace
to Europe; and on the 31st of May, 1711, an order was
issued for the men of the regiment fit for duty to be formed
into two independent companies for service at Jamaica:
the officers and staff returning to Europe to recruit.</p>

<p>The two independent companies thus formed from the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> were the nucleus of the <span class="allsmcap">FORTY-NINTH</span>
regiment, which was formed of independent companies at
Jamaica in 1743.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1715<br />1718</div>

<p>The officers and the serjeants not required for the
independent companies, having arrived in England, were
actively employed in recruiting in 1715; and in 1718
the regiment proceeded to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1719<br />1726</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed in Ireland during the eight
years from 1719 to 1726, and in the spring of the last-mentioned
year, it proceeded to the island of Minorca,
which had been captured by the English, in 1708, and
was ceded to Great Britain by the treaty of Utrecht in
1713, together with the fortress of Gibraltar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1727</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1727, the Spaniards besieged
<em>Gibraltar</em>, and a detachment of the regiment, being sent
to reinforce the garrison, had the honor to take part in
the successful defence of that important fortress. When
the Spaniards raised the siege, the detachment rejoined
the regiment at Minorca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1730</div>

<p>Colonel Handasyd commanded the regiment with
reputation until 1730, when he was removed to the
Sixteenth foot, and was succeeded by Brigadier-General
William Barrell, from the Twenty-eighth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1734</div>

<p>Brigadier-General Barrell was removed to the Fourth
foot in 1734, when King George II. conferred the
colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment on Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the Honorable James St. Clair, from Major in the First
foot-guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1737</div>

<p>On the 27th of June, 1737, Colonel the Honorable
James St. Clair was removed to the First, the Royal
regiment of foot, and his Majesty nominated Major-General
John Moyle, from the Thirty-sixth, to the colonelcy
of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1738</div>

<p>Major-General Moyle died on the 3rd of November,
1738, and the colonelcy was afterwards conferred on
Colonel Thomas Paget, from the Thirty-second regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1739<br />1741</div>

<p>In 1739 Colonel Paget was promoted to the rank of
brigadier-general. He died on the 28th of May, 1741,
and was succeeded in the colonelcy of the regiment by
Lieut.-Colonel Richard O'Farrell, from the Ninth foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748<br />1749</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment was employed in the
protection of the island of Minorca, during the whole of
the War of the Austrian Succession, and, peace having
been concluded, it was relieved from that duty in 1749,
and proceeded to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>In the Royal Warrant for regulating the uniform and
distinctions of the several regiments of the army, dated
the 1st of July, 1751, the facings of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
regiment were directed to be of <em>pale buff</em>. The First, or
King's colour, was the Great Union; the Second, or
Regimental colour, was of pale buff silk, with the Union in
the upper canton; in the centre of the colour, the Number
of the Rank of the regiment, in gold Roman characters,
within a wreath of roses and thistles on the same stalk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755<br />1756</div>

<p>The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was interrupted in 1755
by the aggressions of the French on the British territory in
North America; and on the 18th of May, 1756, war was
declared against France; in the same year the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
regiment embarked from Ireland for North
America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757</div>

<p>In 1757 the regiment was formed in brigade with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Forty-third, Forty-eighth, and fourth battalion of the
Sixtieth, under Major-General Lord Charles Hay, with
the view of being employed in the attack of <em>Louisburg</em>,
the capital of the French island of <em>Cape Breton</em>, situate
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence; but the expedition was
deferred until the following year, and the regiment was
stationed in Nova Scotia during the winter. Major-General
O'Farrell died in the summer of this year, and the
colonelcy of the regiment was conferred on Brigadier-General
Edward Whitmore, from the lieut.-colonelcy of
the Thirty-sixth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>Embarking from Halifax, in May, 1758, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Andrew Lord Rollo, the
regiment proceeded with the expedition commanded by
Lieut.-General (afterwards Lord) Amherst, and a landing
was effected on the island of Cape Breton, on the 8th
of June, when the British troops evinced great gallantry.
The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> had Lieutenants Pierce Butler,
John Jermyn, and William Hamilton wounded; also
several private soldiers killed and wounded.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The siege of <em>Louisburg</em>, the capital of the island, was
afterwards commenced; and in carrying on the approaches
the troops underwent great fatigue with cheerful alacrity.
By their perseverance, and the co-operation of the fleet,
the town was taken in July, and two other islands in the
Gulf were surrendered. The troops received the thanks
of Parliament, and the approbation of the Sovereign, for
their conduct on this occasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>During the year 1759 the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment
was stationed at Louisburg. Major-General James
Wolfe proceeded up the river St. Lawrence, with a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
armament,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and Quebec was captured; but the nation
sustained the loss of Major-General Wolfe, who was
killed in the battle on the heights of Abraham, in front
of Quebec, on the 13th of September, 1759.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>In the spring of 1760 the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> and Fortieth
regiments proceeded from Louisburg, under Colonel
Lord Rollo, of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, up the river St.
Lawrence, to Quebec, from whence they advanced upon
<em>Montreal</em>, with the troops under Brigadier-General the
Honorable James Murray. The French possessions in
Canada were invaded at three points, and the Governor
concentrated his forces at Montreal; but he was unable
to withstand the valour and discipline of British troops,
commanded by officers of talent and experience; he
therefore surrendered Montreal, and with it all Canada,
the French battalions becoming prisoners of war. The
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> had thus the honor of taking part in the
conquest of the two fine provinces of Upper and Lower
Canada, which have since continued to form part of the
possessions of the British Crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<p>After the conquest of Canada, the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
were removed to Albany, from whence they proceeded to
New York, in April, 1761, and afterwards embarked,
under Lord Rollo, for the West Indies.</p>

<p>The island of <em>Dominica</em> had been declared neutral; but
it was found to be so much under the influence of France,
and proved a refuge to so many privateers of that nation,
that the British government resolved to take possession of
it. The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, and other corps under
Lord Rollo, landed on the island on the 6th of June,
under cover of the fire of the men-of-war, and drove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the enemy from his batteries: the grenadiers of the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment distinguished themselves on
this occasion. In two days the island was reduced to
submission with little loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>From Dominica the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> proceeded to
Carlisle Bay, Barbadoes, and joined the troops assembled
at that place under the orders of Major-General the
Honorable Robert Monckton, for the attack of the French
island of <em>Martinique</em>. After several attempts on other
parts of the island, a landing was effected in Cas des
Navières Bay, on the 16th of January, 1762; the works
on the heights of <em>Morne Tortenson</em> were captured on the
24th of that month; <em>Morne Garnier</em> was carried on the
27th; and the citadel of <em>Fort Royal</em> surrendered on the
4th of February. These successes were followed by the
surrender of the opulent city of St. Pierre, and the
submission of the whole island to the British Crown. The
Commander of the expedition stated in his despatch&mdash;"I
cannot find words to render that ample justice which is
due to the valor of his Majesty's troops which I have
had the honor to command. The difficulties they had
to encounter in the attack of an enemy possessed of
every advantage of art and nature were great; and
their perseverance in surmounting these obstacles,
furnishes a noble example of British spirit."</p>

<p>The capture of Martinique was followed by that of
<em>Grenada</em>, <em>St. Lucia</em>, and <em>St. Vincent</em>; and the acquisition
of these islands gave additional honor to the expedition of
which the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment formed part.</p>

<p>Additional forces arrived in the West Indies, and the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment, mustering six hundred and
two rank and file, under the command of Major Loftus,
joined the expedition commanded by General the Earl of
Albemarle, for the reduction of the wealthy and important
Spanish city of the <em>Havannah</em>, in the island of Cuba<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, Fortieth, Seventy-second, and five
companies of the Ninetieth, were formed in brigade under
Brigadier-General Lord Rollo.</p>

<p>Proceeding through the Straits of Bahama, the armament
arrived within six leagues of the Havannah on the 6th
of June. A landing was effected on the following day,
and the <em>Moro</em> fort, being the key-position of the extensive
works which covered the town, was besieged. This proved
an undertaking of great difficulty; but every obstacle
was overcome by the spirited efforts of the land and sea
forces, and the fort was captured by storm on the 30th of
July. An extensive series of batteries was prepared, and
opened, on the 11th of August, so well-directed a fire on the
works which protected the town, that the guns of the garrison
were soon silenced, and the important city of the Havannah
was surrendered to the British arms. Nine Spanish
men-of-war were delivered up; two were found upon the
stocks; and three sunk at the entrance of the harbour.</p>

<p>In March of this year Major-General Whitmore, who
was drowned at sea, was succeeded in the colonelcy by
Major-General the Honorable Thomas Gage, from the
Eightieth regiment, a provincial corps which was raised in
1758, and disbanded after the treaty of Fontainebleau.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>At the peace of Fontainebleau the <em>Havannah</em> was restored
to Spain, in exchange for the province of Florida,
on the continent of America; and in 1763 the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
regiment proceeded to <em>West Florida</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1764<br />1765</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed in Florida during the year
1764, and in 1765 it was relieved from duty in that
province, and embarked for Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1766<br />1770<br />1772<br />1773</div>

<p>From 1766 to 1769 the regiment was employed at
various stations in England; during the years 1770,
1771, and 1772, it performed duty in Scotland; and in
1773 it proceeded to Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>While the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> were stationed in Ireland
the misunderstanding between the English government
and the British provinces in North America, on the subject
of taxation, was followed by hostilities. The regiment
embarked from Ireland for North America in 1775, and
joined the troops at Boston under General Gage.</p>

<p>During the night of the 16th of June the Americans
commenced fortifying the heights on the peninsula of
Charlestown, called <em>Bunker's Hill</em>; and on the following
day they were attacked by the flank companies of the
British corps, and by a few regiments, and driven from
their works. The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> lost their commanding
officer, Lieut.-Colonel James Abercromby, who
died of his wounds. He was succeeded by Major
James Campbell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>General Sir William Howe assumed the command of
the British troops in North America, on General Gage
returning to England in October, 1775; in March, 1776,
Boston was vacated, when the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> proceeded
to Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>From Nova Scotia, the regiment sailed with the expedition
to Staten Island, near New York; and, additional
troops having arrived from Europe, it was formed in
brigade with the Forty-third, Fifty-fourth, and Sixty-third,
under Brigadier-General Francis Smith.</p>

<p>A landing was effected on <em>Long Island</em> on the 22nd of
August; and on the 27th of that month the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
were engaged in driving the Americans from
their positions at <em>Flat Bush</em> to their fortified lines at
<em>Brooklyn</em>. The flank companies had several men killed
and wounded on this occasion; the loss of the battalion
companies was limited to two men.</p>

<p>The Americans abandoned their lines at Brooklyn, and
passed the river to New York. They were followed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the British, who gained possession of New York, captured
Fort Washington, and reduced a great part of the
Jerseys.</p>

<p>During the winter the regiment was detached, with
several other corps, under Lieut.-Generals Clinton and
Earl Percy, against <em>Rhode Island</em>. The regiment embarked
on this service in the beginning of December, and
a landing being effected at daybreak on the 9th of that
month, the island was speedily reduced to submission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<p>During the year 1777 the regiment was stationed in
Rhode Island. On the 10th of July the American
Colonel, Barton, arrived at Rhode Island with a few active
men, surprised Major-General Richard Prescott in his
quarters, and conveyed him from the island a prisoner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>In May, 1778, it was ascertained that Major-General
Sullivan had taken the command of the American troops
at Providence, with the view of making a descent on
Rhode Island; and on the night of the 24th of May the
battalion companies of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, the flank
companies of the Fifty-fourth, and a company of Hessians,
embarked under Lieut.-Colonel Campbell of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>,
to attack the enemy's quarters. After landing
three miles below <em>Warren</em>, early on the following morning,
a detachment under Captain Seir of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
destroyed a battery at Papasquash Point, making a
Captain and six American artillery men prisoners. Another
detachment destroyed a number of boats, a galley
of six twelve pounders, and two sloops, in the Kickamuct
River. The party then marched to Warren, destroyed a
park of artillery, a quantity of stores, and a privateer
sloop. Afterwards proceeding to Bristol, a further
quantity of stores was destroyed. The Americans assembled
in great numbers, and fired on the British from
a great distance, but did little injury. Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
<span class="smcap">Hamilton</span> of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, eight British, and
four Hessian soldiers were wounded.</p>

<p>On the 30th of May another detachment, under Major
Eyre of the Fifty-fourth, made a successful incursion to
a creek near Taunton River, and inflicted a severe loss on
the Americans.</p>

<p>The King of France having united with the Americans,
a French armament arrived off the coast, and formidable
preparations were made for the re-capture of Rhode
Island. The French fleet, however, sustained some
severe losses from a storm, and from the English navy.
A numerous American force under Major-General Sullivan
landed at Howland's Ferry, on the 9th of August, and
commenced the siege of <em>Newport</em>, in defence of which place
the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> were employed. The place being defended
with great resolution, and the Americans being disappointed
of aid from the French fleet, they raised the siege,
and retired on the 29th of August. The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>,
Forty-third, and flank companies of the Thirty-eighth and
Fifty-fourth regiments, marched under Brigadier-General
Smith, by the east road, to intercept the retreating
enemy. A stand was made by the Americans, and some
sharp fighting occurred, in which the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>,
under Lieut.-Colonel Campbell, highly distinguished
themselves. The Americans were driven from <em>Quakers'
Hill</em>, when they fell back to their works at the north end
of the island, from which they afterwards withdrew.
Major-General Pigot stated in his public despatch,&mdash;"To
these particulars I am, in justice, obliged to add
Brigadier-General Smith's report, who, amidst the
general tribute due to the good conduct of every individual
under his command, has particularly distinguished
Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Campbell</span> and the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
regiment, on whom, by their position, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
greatest weight of the action fell." The regiment had
eleven rank and file killed; Lieutenant Cleghorn, Ensigns
Bareland, Proctor, and Adam, two serjeants, and forty-eight
rank and file wounded; one man missing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>The British Commander-in-Chief in North America,
Lieut.-General Sir Henry Clinton, having resolved to
vacate Rhode Island, the regiment embarked from thence
on the 25th of October, 1779, and proceeded to New
York, where it arrived on the 27th of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1780</div>

<p>During the remainder of the American War the regiment
was stationed at New York and the posts in advance
of that city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>General the Honorable Thomas Gage was removed
to the Seventeenth Light Dragoons in April, 1782, and
King George III. conferred the colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
regiment on Major-General Charles O'Hara,
from captain and lieut.-colonel in the Second foot-guards.</p>

<p>A letter, dated the 31st of August, 1782, conveyed to
the regiment His Majesty's pleasure that it should be
designated the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, or the <span class="allsmcap">CHESHIRE</span> regiment,
in order that a connexion between the corps and
that county should be cultivated, with the view of promoting
the success of the recruiting service.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1783</div>

<p>The American War having terminated, the regiment
returned to Europe in 1783 and was stationed in South
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1785</div>

<p>In 1785, while the regiment was stationed at Windsor,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Crosbie, and
furnished the usual guard at the Castle, where his Majesty
resided, an "<span class="allsmcap">ORDER OF MERIT</span>" was instituted in the corps,
with the view of promoting good order and discipline,&mdash;the
field-officers, captains, and adjutant for the time
being, to be members of the order. The order consisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
of <span class="allsmcap">THREE CLASSES</span>: the first wore a silver medal gilt,
suspended to a blue riband two inches broad, and worn
round the neck; the second a silver medal, and the third
a bronze medal, similarly worn. The candidates for the
third class must have served seven years with an unblemished
character; for the second, fourteen; and for
the first, twenty-one years. On the 1st of July, the
<span class="smcap">King</span> was graciously pleased to accept from Lieut.-Colonel
Crosbie a medal of the first class of the regimental <span class="smcap">Order
of Merit</span>: and on the 3rd of that month, the regiment
being then encamped in Windsor Forest, assembled on
parade, with the non-commissioned officers and soldiers
selected to receive medals in front, the rules of the order
were read; the corps presented arms, the band played
"God save the King;" the members of the order took
off their hats, and the commanding officer invested each
member with his medal; the drums beating a point of
war during the whole time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1787</div>

<p>In 1787 the regiment proceeded to Guernsey and
Jersey, where its establishment was augmented; and it
was ordered to be held in readiness for foreign service,
in consequence of some revolutionary proceedings in
Holland. In October the regiment proceeded to Portsmouth,
and its establishment was soon afterwards reduced.
Previous to leaving Guernsey, it received the thanks of
the Lieut.-Governor for its excellent conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1788</div>

<p>On quitting Portsmouth in 1788 for Chatham, the
regiment received a very flattering mark of the high
estimation in which its conduct was held by the inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1790</div>

<p>The regiment left Chatham and Dover in the spring
of 1790, and proceeding to Ireland landed at Cork on
the 5th of April.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1791</div>

<p>Major-General Charles O'Hara was removed to the
Seventy-fourth Highlanders in April, 1791, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
by Major-General David Dundas, Adjutant-General of
the Army in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1792</div>

<p>In 1792, a slight alteration was made in the uniform,
and the establishment was augmented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>Meanwhile a revolution had taken place in France,
and the violent conduct of the republican government in
that country occasioned a war between Great Britain and
France, which commenced in 1793. In September of
that year the flank companies of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
regiment embarked for the West Indies, for the purpose
of taking part in the capture of the French West India
islands. They were followed by the battalion companies
in December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>The flank companies joined the armament under General
Sir Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey, who effected a landing
at three different points on the island of <em>Martinique</em>, in
February, 1794, and accomplished in a short period the
conquest of that valuable colony.</p>

<p>The grenadier brigade under His Royal Highness
Prince Edward, afterwards the Duke of Kent, and the
light infantry under Major-General Dundas, were engaged
in the conquest of <em>St. Lucia</em> in the beginning of April.</p>

<p>After the conquest of St. Lucia, an attack was made on
<em>Guadaloupe</em>, and that valuable island was speedily rescued
from the power of the republican government of France.</p>

<p>The regiment proceeded to the island of Martinique,
where it was joined by the flank companies.</p>

<p>Two hundred men, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Lysaght, proceeded to the island of <em>St. Domingo</em>, and
formed part of the garrison of Cape St. Nicholas Mole:
and five companies joined the garrison of <em>Busy-town</em>,
which place was besieged by the enemy.</p>

<p>In April, the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, Twenty-third, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Forty-first regiments, with some other troops, embarked
under the command of Brigadier-General John Whyte,
for the attack of <em>Port-au-Prince</em>, the capital of the French
possessions in the island of <em>St. Domingo</em>. A landing was
effected on the 31st of May; some severe fighting occurred,
in which the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> distinguished themselves:
<em>Fort Bizzotton</em> was captured, and the enemy was
forced to abandon <em>Port-au-Prince</em>, which was taken possession
of by the British troops. The regiment had
Captain Wallace killed on this occasion, also several
private soldiers killed and wounded. Unfortunately a
malignant fever broke out in the town, and the British
lost forty officers and six hundred soldiers by disease
within two months after the capture of the place.</p>

<p>A detachment of the regiment formed part of the
garrison of <em>Fort Bizzotton</em>, which was attacked by two
thousand of the enemy on the 5th of December. The
British defended their post with great gallantry, and
repulsed the assailants. Lieutenant Hamilton of the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> distinguished himself.</p>

<p>Another portion of the regiment was stationed at
Jeremie, and a detachment at Irois.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1795</div>

<p>Having sustained severe loss from the climate of St.
Domingo, the regiment was relieved from duty at that
island, and returned to England in 1795.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Dundas was removed to the Seventh
Light Dragoons, and the colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
was conferred on Major-General William Crosbie, from
the Eighty-ninth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1798</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed in England recruiting its
ranks until December, 1798, when it proceeded to Guernsey.</p>

<p>Major-General Crosbie died this year, and was succeeded
by Major-General John Graves Simcoe, from the
Eighty-first regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1799</div>

<p>In November, 1799, the regiment was withdrawn from
Guernsey, and landed at Portsmouth on the 15th of that
month.</p>

<p>On its return from the West Indies, the regiment
enlisted a number of boys, or youths; and in 1798 it
received drafts of boys, or lads, from other corps; it was
designated a boy regiment, and sent to the Cape of Good
Hope, where the youths, it was conjectured, would be
gradually accustomed to a warm climate, and become
better adapted for service in the East Indies, than recruits
sent direct from Europe to India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>In January and February, 1800, the regiment embarked
for the Cape of Good Hope, where it arrived in
May and June following. The companies on board of
one transport, the Surat Castle, suffered severely in consequence
of their crowded state: the crew was composed
of Lascars, among whom much disease prevailed; the
infection was communicated to the soldiers, and the men
of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> suffered in their health; sixty
soldiers were sent on shore, to a general hospital, before
the ship left England. The survivors arrived at the Cape
in a sickly state; they had been obliged to aid in working
the vessel during the voyage, and the masts and rigging
had been damaged during a gale of wind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>The head-quarters were established at Muisenberg,
and afterwards encamped at Wynberg, a tongue of land
projecting from the east side of Table Mountain. The
sick men received every attention which could be procured
by Major-General Francis Dundas, commanding at the
Cape, and as they recovered they joined the head-quarters,
which were removed to Simon's-town in January, 1801,
and again encamped at Wynberg in March. In May
the regiment marched into Cape Town, and in September
joined the camp at Rondebosch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>The lads having become much improved in size and
strength, the light infantry company joined the flank
battalion; and the grenadiers were detached to the interior,
and stationed at Graaff Reinett.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>Leaving the camp in January, 1802, the regiment was
removed to Muisenberg, Simon's-town, and Graaff Reinett.</p>

<p>The period having arrived for the regiment to proceed
to India, it was joined by a number of volunteers from
corps serving at the Cape of Good Hope, and embarked
from thence in September, October, and November, when
it mustered thirty-one officers, and one thousand and
fifty-five non-commissioned officers and soldiers fit for
duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>In February, 1803, the last division of the regiment
landed at Fort William, Calcutta, where the other companies
had previously arrived.</p>

<p>At this period two powerful chieftains, Dowlat Rao
Scindia and Jeswunt Rao Holkar, had usurped the powers
of the Peishwa, and were desolating the Mahratta states
with war; and these two chiefs, with the Rajah of Berar,
formed a confederacy against the British and their allies.
Under these circumstances the flank companies of the
regiment embarked from Fort William, and joined the
field force, under Lieut.-Colonel Harcourt, assembled for
the attack of the province of Cuttack. On entering that
province, the troops had to overcome numerous difficulties
from the nature of the country, the season of the year,
and the resistance of the enemy, which they surmounted
with great gallantry.</p>

<p>On the 4th of October, the flank companies of the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment highly distinguished themselves
at the capture of the fort of <em>Barrabatta</em> by storm, when
they led the assault, and took several of the enemy's colours.
They had one man killed; Captain Harlston and eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
soldiers wounded. The colours captured by the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>,
with some others taken by the Ninth and Nineteenth
Native Infantry, were publicly displayed at
Calcutta, and afterwards lodged at Fort William, with
an inscription of the names of the corps by which taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>The flank companies of the regiment remained in the
field, and the splendid successes of the British arms appeared
likely to bring about a speedy termination of the
war; but hostilities were protracted by the defection of the
Rajah of Bhurtpore. The flank companies of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
joined the army under Lord Lake: they had two
men killed and three wounded at the capture of <em>Deeg</em>, in
December, and were engaged in the attempt to bring the
refractory Rajah Sing to submission by the siege of the
strong fortress of Bhurtpore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>In the meantime, the regiment had commenced its
march from Fort William, for the Upper provinces, and
in January, 1805, it halted and encamped at Benares;
but resumed its march in February, and proceeded to
Cawnpore.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Bhurtpore</em> was carried on, and the flank
companies were engaged in the unsuccessful attempt to
capture that place by storm on the 9th of January, when
they had eleven men killed and twenty-four wounded.
They were also engaged in the desperate attempt to
capture the place by storm, on the 21st of January, when
they had Captain Menzies and four men killed; Captains
Lindsay and McNight, Lieutenants Mansergh, Sweetman,
and Caswell, and thirty-one non-commissioned officers and
soldiers, wounded. At the third unsuccessful attack, on
the 21st of February, they had two serjeants and three
soldiers killed; three serjeants and four soldiers wounded.</p>

<p>Serjeant John Ship, of the regiment, led the forlorn
hope on each occasion, and his gallant conduct was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
rewarded with the commission of ensign in the Sixty-fifth
regiment.</p>

<p>Rajah Sing submitted, and concluded a treaty of peace
with the British: the army withdrew from Bhurtpore,
and the surviving officers and soldiers of the flank companies
joined the regiment at Cawnpore, in June.</p>

<p>Holkar continued his resistance to the British authority,
and Scindia evinced a disposition to renew hostilities.
These events occasioned the regiment to quit Cawnpore,
in October, to pursue the army of Holkar, who was driven
from place to place, until the British troops arrived at the
banks of the Hyphasis, or Sutlej, where he submitted, and
a treaty of peace was concluded in December. Scindia
also concluded a second treaty, and the British power and
influence in India were thus augmented and consolidated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>From the banks of the Sutlej, the regiment marched
to Delhi, where it arrived in February, 1806, and in
March it was removed to Muttra, where it received the
thanks of General Lord Lake, and of the Governor-General
in Council, for its conduct during the war.</p>

<p>On the 30th of October, General Simcoe, who died in
1806, was succeeded in the colonelcy of the regiment by
Lieut.-General Sir James Henry Craig, from the Eighty-sixth
foot.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1807</div>

<p>Leaving Muttra in July, 1807, the regiment proceeded
to Berhampore, where it arrived on the 7th of August.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>Major-General the Honorable Edward Finch was appointed
colonel of the regiment on the 18th of September,
1809, from the Fifty-fourth foot, in succession to Sir
James Henry Craig, K.B., removed to the Seventy-eighth
Highlanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Berhampore until August,
1810, when it embarked in boats, and proceeded to Fort
William, in order to form part of the expedition against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the <em>Mauritius</em>, under Major-General the Honorable J.
Abercromby. A landing was effected in the bay of
Mapou, on the 29th of November, without opposition,
and on the following day the troops advanced towards the
capital; being exposed to severe heat, and unable to
procure water, the soldiers became exhausted, and arriving
at the powder-mills, five miles from Port Louis, they halted
near the stream. Resuming the march on the 1st of
December, the troops were opposed by the enemy in
force, and some sharp fighting occurred, in which the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> took part and had several men wounded.
The French were driven from their ground, and they
fell back upon Port Louis; the British took post in front
of the position occupied by the French. Being unable to
withstand the valour and discipline of the invading army,
the governor, General de Caen, surrendered the island to
the British arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>After the capture of the Mauritius, the regiment was
stationed a short time at that island, and in January it
sent a detachment of five officers and seventy men to Tamatave,
in the Island of Madagascar. In March and April
the regiment was removed to the island of Bourbon, where
it was joined by the survivors of the detachment from
Madagascar, reduced in number, by disease, to two officers
and twenty-five men: they had been made prisoners by
the enemy, and re-captured by the British ships of war.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1812<br />1813</div>

<p>In July, 1812, the regiment returned to the Mauritius;
but again proceeded to Bourbon, in August, and was
removed to the Mauritius a second time in May, 1813.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814<br />1815</div>

<p>A number of men having volunteered from the militia
to the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment, His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent was pleased to approve of a <em>second
battalion</em> being formed, and it was placed on the establishment
of the army on the 10th of February, 1814.
The war in Europe being terminated soon afterwards, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the abdication of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the restoration
of the Bourbon dynasty to the throne of France, the second
battalion was disbanded at Chester, on the 24th of October,
transferring the men fit for duty to the first battalion,
which they joined at the Mauritius, in April, 1815, in so
good a state, as to be specially noticed in general orders,
and Captain Thomas Poole, commanding the party,
received the thanks of the governor.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, 1815, the rifle company of the first
battalion of the Twelfth regiment, together with the first
battalion of the Eighty-seventh regiment, and the flank
companies of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment, were formed
into a field brigade, and on the 16th of June embarked
from the Mauritius to join the army in Bengal. The
troops arrived at Bengal on the 2nd and 3rd of August;
re-embarked on the 23rd of September, and landed at
the Mauritius on the 14th of November, 1815. The
light company of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment, while
on passage to Bengal, was wrecked in the Straits between
Ceylon and the opposite continent. The conduct of the
flank companies, while in India, was highly commended
in general orders issued before they embarked from Fort
William,&mdash;on their return to the Mauritius.</p>

<p>While the flank companies were thus employed, the remainder
of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment was placed
under canvas at Pamplemousse, seven miles from Port
Louis, as it was suffering severely from a prevailing disease
at the Mauritius. There being but a small force
left on the island, and this reduced in numbers and efficiency
by disease, a meditated insurrection had nearly attained
an outbreak, but for timely information.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>The regiment occupied various stations at the Mauritius,
under the command of Colonel Dalrymple, until July,
1819, when it embarked for England. Previous to quitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the island it was inspected by Major-General Ralph
Darling, who expressed, in general orders, his admiration
of its appearance, and of its excellent conduct while
serving under his command.</p>

<p>Though the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> had participated in the
capture of the Mauritius, the French inhabitants of the
island presented a large and handsome gold snuff-box to
the regiment on its embarkation for England, bearing
this inscription, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aux Officiers du 22 Régiment de S. M.&mdash;Souvenir
des Habitans de l'île Maurice</i>; 1819;" thus
testifying their good feeling, and appreciation of the orderly
and soldierlike conduct of the corps during its
service of nine years in the colony.</p>

<p>After landing at Gosport, in November and December,
the regiment marched to Northampton, under the orders
of Colonel Sir Hugh Gough, K.C.B.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>In the Autumn of 1821 the regiment marched to
Liverpool, where it embarked on the 9th of October, for
Ireland. Having landed at Dublin on the 10th of October,
the regiment marched to Buttevant, with detachments at
Mallow, Bantyre, Charleville, Newmarket, and Ballyclough.</p>

<p>Some changes of quarters afterwards took place in
consequence of the riotous and violent proceedings of the
misguided peasantry at this part of the country, and the
disposition evinced to violate the law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>On the evening of the 25th of January, 1822, three
thousand men assembled with such arms as they could
procure, for an attack on Newmarket; and they were
repulsed, with severe loss, by thirty men of the regiment,
under Captain Thomas Keappock and Lieutenant Samuel
Green, who received the expression of the approbation of
His Royal Highness the Duke of York, the Commander-in-Chief,
and were presented with a silver cup, by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
noblemen, gentlemen, and inhabitants of the town and
vicinity of Newmarket,&mdash;"In testimony of the high sense
entertained of their gallant conduct in attacking and
defeating an armed body of three thousand insurgents,
with thirty men."</p>

<p>A reinforcement was sent to Newmarket, and the
regiment performed many marches, and much extra
duty, in consequence of the disturbed state of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823<br />1824</div>

<p>The head-quarters of the regiment were stationed at
Buttevant during the year 1823, and the first nine months
of 1824; and the state of the regiment was repeatedly
commended in orders by the General Officers who made
the half-yearly inspections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<p>In October, 1824, the regiment marched to Dublin; it
was subsequently stationed in Galway, and in the summer
of 1826 it was divided into six service and four depôt
companies, in order that the former might proceed on
foreign service.</p>

<p>The service companies embarked from Cork in November
and December, in three divisions, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel P. C. Taylor, Major James Steuart, and
Captain Thomas Poole, and the last division arrived at
the island of Jamaica in February, 1827.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>The service companies suffered severely from the effects
of the climate of Jamaica; in September and October,
1827, they lost three officers, seventeen serjeants, and one
hundred and twenty men, from fever; the total loss during
the first year was Lieut.-Colonel P. C. Taylor, Major James
Steuart, Captain William Norton, Lieutenant Edward
Gordon, Ensign E. T. Evans, Paymaster R. Barlow, Adjutant
William Potenger, and one hundred and seventy-two
non-commissioned officers and soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828<br />1829</div>

<p>In the following year the losses were much less numerous;
and in April, 1829, Lieut.-Colonel C. G. Falconar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
arrived and assumed the command. In June of the same
year, the regiment received the thanks of the civil authorities
for the prompt assistance rendered in extinguishing
an alarming fire in the vicinity of Spanish Town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>On the 7th of June, 1830, the depôt companies embarked
from Cork for South Britain, where they were
stationed until the summer of 1836, when they embarked
from Liverpool for Ireland, and landed at Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>The regiment was employed in suppressing a formidable
insurrection among the slaves in Jamaica in the
winter of 1831-2; the two flank companies were
encamped on the scene of the insurrection in the following
winter, and when the regiment left Falmouth, in
Jamaica, in the latter part of the year 1833, the thanks
of the custos and magistrates were awarded to the corps
for its good conduct.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>The service companies performed duty at the island of
Jamaica until the beginning of 1837, when they commenced
embarking for Europe, and landed at Cork in
March and April; they were afterwards joined by the
depôt companies.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1838<br />1839<br />1840</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Ireland during the years
1838 and 1839; and embarking from Dublin on the 19th
of December, 1840, landed at Liverpool on the 21st of
that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment, having been selected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to proceed to India, embarked from Gravesend in January,
1841, and landed at Bombay in May following. It afterwards
proceeded to Poonah, where an encampment was
formed, and the regiment was stationed there during the
remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>In the following year the regiment quitted the camp
at Poonah by divisions, and proceeding to the country of
Scinde, was encamped some time near Kurrachee. The
regiment was encamped in two separate divisions at
Kurrachee, as cholera had broken out violently in its
ranks, from which it suffered severely, and during its
prevalence a field-officer's detachment, under Major Poole,
consisting of two companies, was ordered to proceed by
the Indus, in the month of April, 1842, to Sukkur, in
Upper Scinde, previously to the withdrawal of the British
force from Beloochistan.</p>

<p>The navigation of the Indus had been acquired by the
British in 1839, and application was made to the Ameers,
who governed the country, for a portion of land on the banks
of the river. This they agreed to give; but at the same
time meditated the destruction of the British power in the
country by treachery. The <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> quitted the
camp at Kurrachee in November, and proceeded up the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1843</div>

<p>The regiment formed part of the force assembled under
Major-General Sir Charles Napier, and was employed in
the destruction of the fort of <em>Emaum Ghur</em>, in the desert,
on the 14th and 15th of January, 1843.</p>

<p>Major-General W. F. P. Napier, in his work entitled
"<em>The Conquest of Scinde</em>," has given, with his characteristic
eloquence, the following spirited description of the
march to <em>Emaum Ghur</em>, a march which His Grace the
Duke of Wellington described in the House of Lords, "<em>as
one of the most curious military feats he had ever known to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
be performed, or had ever perused an account of in his life.
Sir Charles Napier</em> (added His Grace) <em>moved his troops
through the desert against hostile forces; he had his guns
transported under circumstances of extreme difficulty, and
in a manner the most extraordinary; and he cut off a retreat
of the enemy which rendered it impossible for them ever to
regain their positions</em>."</p>

<p>"It was a wild and singular country, the wilderness
through which they (the Anglo-Indian troops) were
passing. The sand-hills stretched north and south for
hundreds of miles in parallel ridges, rounded at top, and
most symmetrically plaited, like the ripple on the sea-shore
after a placid tide. Varying in their heights,
their breadth and steepness, they presented one uniform
surface, but while some were only a mile broad, others
were more than ten miles across; some were of gentle
slopes and low, others lofty, and so steep that the
howitzers could only be dragged up by men. The
sand was mingled with shells, and ran in great streams
resembling numerous rivers, skirted on each side by
parallel streaks of soil, which nourished jungle, yet
thinly and scattered. The tracks of the hyena and
wild boar, and the prints of small deer's footsteps, were
sometimes seen at first, but they soon disappeared, and
then the solitude of the waste was unbroken.</p>

<p>"For eight days these intrepid soldiers traversed this
gloomy region, living from hand to mouth, uncertain
each morning if water could be found in the evening;
and many times it was not found. They were not even
sure of their right course; yet with fiery valour and
untiring strength, they continued their dreary dangerous
way. The camels found very little food, and got weak,
but the stout infantry helped to drag the heavy howitzers
up the sandy steeps; and all the troops, despising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the danger of an attack from the Beloochees, worked
with a power and will that overcame every obstacle.
On the eighth day they reached <em>Emaum Ghur</em>, eager
to strike and storm, and then was seen how truly laid
down is Napoleon's great maxim, that moral force is in
war to physical force, as four to one. Mahomed Khan,
with a strong fortress well provided, and having a garrison
six times as numerous as the band coming to
assail him, had fled with his treasure two days before;
taking a southerly direction, he regained the Indus by
tracks with which his people were well acquainted,
leaving all his stores of grain and powder behind."</p>

<p>As Emaum Ghur could only serve as a stronghold in
which the Beloochees might be able to resist British
supremacy, Major-General Sir Charles Napier determined
upon destroying the fortress. It was a place of great
strength, and was constructed of unburnt bricks, into
which the shot easily penetrates, but brings nothing
down, so that recourse was had to mining. The place
was full of gunpowder and grain, and the former was
employed in blowing up the fortress, which was effected
on the 15th of January.</p>

<p>After this difficult and harassing service, the troops
returned triumphant on the 23rd of January, to Peer-Abu-Bekr,
where Major-General Sir Charles Napier reunited
his whole army. It is to be observed that the
march was performed without the loss of a man, or without
even a sick soldier, and the Ameers' troops were dispersed,
and their plan of campaign frustrated.</p>

<p>A treaty of peace was signed by the Ameers on the
14th of February: directions were sent to the British
political resident, Major Outram, by the Ameers, to
quit <em>Hyderabad</em>, the capital, and before this was complied
with, <em>eight thousand</em> Beloochees, commanded by several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Ameers in person, attempted to force an entrance into
the enclosure of the British residency. The light company
of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment, mustering <em>one
hundred</em> men, under Captain T. S. Conway, Lieutenant
F. P. Harding, and Ensign R. Pennefather, was the only
force at the residency, the enclosure of which was surrounded
by a wall from four to five feet high. The gallant
officers and soldiers of this company kept the eight
thousand Scindian troops, with six pieces of artillery, at
bay nearly four hours; and when their ammunition was
nearly expended, they retreated to the river, with Major
Outram, and embarking on board of two steam-vessels,
joined the troops under Major-General Sir Charles
Napier, at Hala. The light company had two men killed
and four wounded on this occasion.</p>

<p>The Ameers having thus commenced hostilities, assembled
a numerous force to destroy the few British
troops in the country. Major-General Sir Charles Napier,
trusting to the valour of the troops under his orders,
advanced to meet the enemy. On the 17th of February,
<em>twenty-two thousand</em> Scindian troops were discovered in
position behind the bank of a river at <em>Meeanee</em>. The
British, mustering <em>two thousand eight hundred</em> men, advanced
in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">echelon</i> of regiments to attack their numerous
opponents, and the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel J. L. Pennefather, had the honor to lead
the attack. A numerous body of Beloochees discharged
their matchlocks and pistols at the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, and
then rushed forward sword in hand to close upon the
British line; but these bold and skilful swordsmen went
down under the superior power of the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>After a severe contest the Scindian army was defeated,
and, on the day following the victory, six of the Ameers
delivered their swords to the British General upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
field of battle. The Beloochees lost five thousand men,
and all their guns, ammunition, and treasure were taken,
together with their camp and standards. On the 20th of
February, the British colours waved in triumph over the
fortress of <em>Hyderabad</em>.</p>

<p>In Major-General Napier's admirable work on "<cite>The
Conquest of Scinde</cite>," is given the following spirited and
picturesque description of the battle of <span class="smcap">Meeanee</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Ameers' right was found to be strengthened and
covered by the village of Kattree, which was filled with
men; that flank offered no weak point. But in the
Shikargah on their left the General instantly detected
a flaw. It has been before said this Shikargah was
covered by a wall, having only one opening, not very
wide, through which it was evident the Beloochees
meant to pour out on the flank and rear of the advancing
British line. The General rode near this wall,
and found it was nine or ten feet high; he rode nearer,
and marked it had no loop-holes for the enemy to
shoot through; he rode into the opening under a play
of matchlocks, and, looking behind the wall, saw there
was no scaffolding to enable the Beloochees to fire over
the top. Then the inspiration of genius came to the
aid of heroism. Taking a company of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>,
he thrust them at once into the opening, telling
their brave Captain, Tew, that he was to block up that
entrance; to die there, if it must be,&mdash;never to give way!
And well did the gallant fellow obey his orders: he
died there, but the opening was defended. The great
disparity of numbers was thus abated, and the action
of six thousand men paralysed by the more skilful
action of only eighty! It was, on a smaller scale as to
numbers, a stroke of generalship like that which won
Blenheim for the Duke of Marlborough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>"Now the advancing troops, in echelon of regiments,
approached the enemy's front. The British
right passed securely under the wall of the Shikargah,
cheered and elated as they moved by the rattling
sound of Tew's musketry. * * * * Meanwhile the
dead level of the plain was swept by the Beloochee
cannon and matchlocks, which were answered from
time to time by Lloyd's batteries, yet not frequently, for
rapidly and eagerly did the troops press forward to
close with their unseen foes. When the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
had got within a hundred yards of the high
sloping bank of the Fulaillee, they threw their fire at
the top of the bank, where the heads of the Beloochees
could be just seen, bending with fiery glances over
the levelled matchlocks, and the voice of the General,
shrill and clear, was heard along the line, commanding
the charge.</p>

<p>"Then rose the British shout; the English guns were
run forward into position, the infantry closed upon the
Fulaillee with a run, and rushed up the sloping bank.
The Beloochees, having their matchlocks laid ready in
rest along the summit, waited until the assailants were
within fifteen yards ere their volley was delivered; the
rapid pace of the British, and the steepness of the slope
on the inside, deceived their aim, and the execution
was not great; the next moment the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
were on the top of the bank, thinking to bear down all
before them, but they staggered back in amazement
at the forest of swords waving in their front! Thick
as standing corn, and gorgeous as a field of flowers,
stood the Beloochees in their many-coloured garments
and turbans; they filled the broad deep bed of the
Fulaillee, they clustered on both banks, and covered
the plain beyond. Guarding their heads with their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
large dark shields, they shook their sharp swords,
beaming in the sun, their shouts rolled like a peal of
thunder, as with frantic gestures they rushed forwards,
and full against the front of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
dashed with demoniac strength and ferocity. But with
shouts as loud, and shrieks as wild and fierce as theirs,
and hearts as big, and arms as strong, the Irish soldiers
met them with that queen of weapons the musket, and
sent their foremost masses rolling back in blood."</p>

<p>The following extracts from the despatch of Major-General
Sir Charles Napier testify the part borne by the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> in the victory of <span class="smcap">Meeanee</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lieutenant-Colonel Pennefather was severely
wounded as with the high courage of a soldier he
led his regiment (<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>) up the desperate
bank of the Fulaillee. Major Wyllie, Captains
Tucker and Conway, Lieutenants Harding and
Phayre, were all wounded, while gloriously animating
their men to sustain the shock of numbers."</p>

<p>"Captains Meade, Tew, and Cookson, with Lieutenant
Wood, all fell honorably, urging on the assault with
unmitigated valour.</p>

<p>"Major Poole, of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, and Captain
Jackson of the Twenty-fifth native infantry, who succeeded
to the command of those regiments, proved
themselves worthy of their dangerous posts.</p>

<p>"The Acting Assistant Quartermaster-General,
Lieutenant McMurdo, of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment,
had his horse killed, and, while on foot leading
some soldiers in <ins class="corr" id="tn-34" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'a deperate dash'">
a desperate dash</ins> down the enemy's side of the bank, he cut down a Chieftain. He has
greatly assisted me by his activity and zeal during the
whole of our operations.</p>

<p>"Innumerable are the individual acts of intrepidity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
which took place between our soldiers and their
opponents, too numerous for detail in this despatch, yet
well meriting a record."</p>

<p>In the <span class="allsmcap">NOTIFICATION</span> of the Right Honorable Lord
Ellenborough, the Governor-General of India, it was
directed,</p>

<p>"That the unserviceable guns, taken at Hyderabad,
shall be sent to Bombay, and there cast into a triumphal
column, whereon shall be inscribed in the English, and
two native languages, the names of Major-General
Sir Charles Napier, K.C.B., and of the several officers
mentioned by His Excellency in his despatch, and
likewise the names of the several officers, non-commissioned
officers, and privates mentioned in the reports,
that thus the names may be for ever recorded of those
who, at <span class="smcap">Meeanee</span>, obtained for themselves that glory in
the field, which is the reward dearest to a true soldier."</p>

<p>Major Poole, commanding the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment,
in consequence of Lieutenant-Colonel Pennefather
having been severely wounded, stated in his report,
respecting the soldiers of the regiment under his command,
who had distinguished themselves in the battle of
Meeanee, "that the officers generally assert that they
feel difficulty in making selections, where the conduct
of every man of their companies was so satisfactory.
In so general a field of action and persevering exertion,
I equally feel at a loss where to draw a distinction;
but it may be proper to mention the names of Private
James O'Neill, of the light company, who took a
standard whilst we were actively engaged with the
enemy, and drummer Martin Delaney, who shot,
bayoneted, and captured the arms of Meer Whullee
Mahomed Khan, who was mounted, and directing the
enemy in the hottest part of the engagement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment at the battle
of Meeanee was, Captain J. McLeod Tew,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> one serjeant,
and twenty-two rank and file killed; Lieut.-Colonel J. L.
Pennefather, Captain T. S. Conway, Lieutenants W. M.
G. McMurdo and F. P. Harding, Ensigns R. Pennefather
and H. Bowden, one serjeant, one corporal, and
fifty privates wounded.</p>

<p>The whole of the Ameers did not submit, and the Chiefs
who continued to resist assembled an army, which was
commanded by Meer Shere Mahomed. The British advanced
from <em>Hyderabad</em> at daybreak on the morning of
the 24th of March, and about half-past eight o'clock
twenty thousand Scindian troops were discovered in order
of battle behind a nullah. Arrangements were immediately
made for commencing the action, and the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
regiment led the attack in gallant style. Major
John Poole commanded the brigade, and Captain F. D.
George the regiment, and, stimulated by the heroic
example of these officers, the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> advanced
steadily against the enemy's left, exposed to a heavy fire
of matchlocks, without returning a shot, until they arrived
within forty paces of the entrenchment, when they stormed
the position occupied by the Beloochees with that determined
bravery which has ever distinguished British
soldiers. Lieutenant Henry J. Coote first mounted the
rampart, seized one of the enemy's standards, and was
severely wounded while in the act of waving it, and cheering
on his men; Lieutenant C. T. Powell seized another
standard; and the soldiers, being encouraged by the gallant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
example of their officers, displayed that heroism which
adorns the British military character. Privates J. Doherty,
C. Lynar, E. Jobin, J. McCartin, J. Walmsley, G.
Roberts, E. Watson and J. Oakley, shot the defenders,
and then captured fourteen standards, and made five
prisoners. Privates S. Cowen, S. Alder, and G. Banbury
also captured standards; and Corporal Tim. Kelly shot
one of the Scindians, and took from him a silver-knobbed
standard. The Beloochee infantry and artillery fought
well, but were unable, although greatly superior in
numbers, to resist the determined attack of disciplined
soldiers.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Charles Napier stated in his public
despatch, "The battle was decided by the troop of Horse
Artillery, and Her Majesty's <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment.</p>

<p>"Of Lieutenant McMurdo's abilities as Acting Assistant
Quartermaster-General, I cannot speak too
highly; and regret to say, he has received a sabre
wound from a Beloochee, the third that he cut down in
single combat during the day.</p>

<p>"To the commanders of brigades and regiments, and
the officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates
under their command, I have to return my thanks for
their valiant bearing in the action."</p>

<p>The loss of the enemy was very great, and eleven
pieces of cannon were taken in position on the nullah,
together with seventeen standards. The Beloochee force
was completely defeated, and their commander, Meer Shere
Mahomed, fled to the desert.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Among the killed was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
the great promoter of the war, Hoche Mahomed Seedee.
Twenty-three rank and file of the regiment were killed
on this occasion; Lieutenants Thomas Chute, Henry J.
Coote, H. A. G. Evans, and John Brennan, Ensign
Richard Pennefather, six serjeants, one drummer, four
corporals, and one hundred and twenty-three privates
wounded. At the battle of Hyderabad, the regiment
mustered only five hundred and sixty-two rank and file;
the remainder being sick and convalescent, having been
left at Sukkur in Upper Scinde.</p>

<p>As a mark of Royal approbation for these victories,
Her Majesty, on the 4th of July, 1843, was pleased to appoint
Major-General Sir Charles James Napier a Knight
Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Military Order of
the Bath; Lieutenant-Colonel Pennefather,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Poole, Brevet Majors Frederick George,
and Thomas Conway, were also nominated Companions
of the Bath, and their brevet rank was dated from the
above period.</p>

<p>Her Majesty was also graciously pleased to command
that a medal should be conferred upon the Officers, Non-commissioned
Officers, and Soldiers engaged in the battles
of Meeanee and Hyderabad.</p>

<p>On the 18th of August, 1843, the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
received the Royal authority to bear upon the regimental
or second colour, and on the appointments, the word
"<span class="smcap">Scinde</span>," in commemoration of its distinguished gallantry
in the campaign against the Ameers of that
country, during the early part of the year 1843.</p>

<p>Her Majesty, on the 2nd of July, 1844, conferred
increased honor on the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, by authorising
the corps to bear on the regimental colour and appointments,
in addition to the word "<span class="smcap">Scinde</span>," the words
"<span class="smcap">Meeanee</span>" and "<span class="smcap">Hyderabad</span>," in commemoration of
the distinguished gallantry displayed in the general
engagements fought at those places respectively, on the
17th of February, and 24th of March, 1843.</p>

<p>On the 12th of February, 1844, the thanks of Parliament
were voted to Major-General Sir Charles Napier,
G.C.B., and to the troops under his command, "<em>for the
eminent skill, energy, and gallantry, displayed by him in
the recent military operations in</em> <span class="smcap">Scinde</span>, <em>particularly in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the two decisive battles of</em> <span class="smcap">Meeanee</span> <em>and</em> <span class="smcap">Hyderabad</span>;"
to the several officers serving under Sir Charles Napier,
"<em>for their unwearied zeal and conspicuous gallantry</em>;" and
to the troops, "<em>for their brave and meritorious conduct</em>."</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Charles Napier, on presenting the
regiments at Kurrachee with the Medals conferred on them
for their gallantry in this campaign, addressed the soldiers
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Soldiers! the Battle of <em>Meeanee</em> is among those of
which history will speak as proving the superiority of
<em>discipline</em> over numbers; and it is well, Soldiers! that we
should dwell upon these things; that we may understand
how Medals are won, and why they are bestowed.</p>

<p>"Had we been without discipline, valour alone would
not have won the victories of <em>Meeanee</em> and <em>Hyderabad</em>!
Valour is like the <em>Strength</em> of a man, Discipline is like
his <em>Mind</em>, that directs his strength to effective exertion.
If two pugilists have a boxing-match, and one strikes
at random, while the other boxes with science, planting
every blow home, we know how the fight must be soon
decided. So it is with two armies,&mdash;the one disciplined,
the other without discipline. The General of the disciplined
Army directs his columns upon that part of the
enemy's position which he deems to be the weakest; as
the mind of the boxer directs his blow against the opening
offered by his unskilful enemy. But this is not all,&mdash;obedience
to orders (which is discipline) enables us to
bring up all the necessary provisions of war to the day
and to the hour; thus food and ammunition are at hand
to support the blow of battle, just as the shoulder and
the body are thrown forward to support and give vigour
to the blow of the pugilist. But not only is valour
useless without discipline, but it is even dangerous;
for without discipline the rashly brave would run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
heedlessly against the enemy, the cautious would seek
'vantage ground, and the timid would retreat. Thus
the Army would be scattered: but when an Army is
disciplined, the ponderous charges of Cavalry, the steady
tramp of the advancing Infantry, preparing to charge
with a mighty shout, and the rolling thunder of Artillery
pouring forth its iron shower, all combine simultaneously
to strike and overthrow the enemy. Thus, Soldiers,
are Medals won, more by discipline than by any extraordinary
efforts of individual courage. To reward
this obedience medals are bestowed, so that every man
who wears this honoured badge is known to the world
as one who, in the midst of the noise, the danger, and
confusion of battle, had obeyed orders, and performed
the three great duties of a Soldier&mdash;first, not to fire
without orders; next, when he does fire, to level low, so
as to make sure of striking down an enemy; thirdly, to
keep his rank and dress upon his colours. The Medal
tells the world that he has bravely done these things,
and no man can walk with one of these Medals on his
breast without feeling the conscious pride of an intrepid
Soldier! His caste may be high caste, or it may be
low caste, but the Soldier, who bears on his breast a
medal won in battle, is above all the castes in the world.
The pleasure of giving you these Medals, Soldiers of
the 12th Regiment (Native Infantry), is indeed great to
me. I saw your valiant conduct, and I rejoice in distributing
the reward which you honorably earned, and my
satisfaction is increased by the presence of so large a
body of Europeans, for it affords me an opportunity of
saying to my countrymen that they will find these swarthy
warriors of the East <ins class="corr" id="tn-41" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'stanch and true'">
staunch and true</ins> in action as they were at Meeanee and Hyderabad, when they followed
the example set them by the glorious <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></span>
regiment. They will fight to the last drop of their blood,
and stand or fall by the side of their European comrades.
If the Almighty so wills it, that in these eventful times,
War should again arise, and that I am once more permitted
to lead an Army into the field, I should go into
action with perfect confidence in the courage of the
Native Troops. I speak of what I know of their gallantry,
not from what I hear, but from what I have seen, and
from my own knowledge, of their daring courage.</p>

<p>"Here I must address myself in a more direct manner
to the Officers now before me, and in justice to them
say, that their conduct, and the conduct of all the British
Officers in these two battles, was very noble. For several
hours the two lines were fighting close to each other,
and as I cast my eye along the field, I everywhere saw
the British Officers display their worthiness as Military
leaders, and with unflinching intrepidity animating their
Soldiers to battle! To them, therefore, I will now first
distribute these honorable decorations."</p>

<p>The Governor then dismounted, and advancing to the
line of officers of several regiments, and who had not
before received their medals, his Excellency presented
each with the Medal,&mdash;the bands playing "God save the
Queen."</p>

<p>On giving that which belonged to Lieutenant Marston,
of the 25th N. I., the General observed,&mdash;"But for you,
Marston, I probably should not have had this pleasure;"
alluding to this Officer having intrepidly thrown himself
in front of his General when attacked by a Beloochee
Chief, whom the Lieutenant cut down ere he could reach
the General.</p>

<p>On the 18th of April the regiment left Hyderabad, and
proceeded to Kurrachee, where the right wing and head-quarters
embarked on the 27th of April, and sailed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Bombay. Previously to the embarkation of the regiment
for Bombay, the following order was issued by Major-General
Sir Charles Napier, Governor of Scinde:&mdash;</p>

you also know how much I dislike doing so. But nothing

again join us, and add to the Laurels with which you are

</div>

<p>The reception of the regiment at Bombay, on the 2nd
of May, was distinguished by high marks of honor, by
command of the Governor, on which occasion the accompanying
order was issued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p class="right">"<em>Bombay, Monday, 1st May, 1843.</em></p>

<p>"On this occasion the Governor and Commander-in-Chief
of the Garrison, desirous of paying every mark of

it at the Apollo Pier.</p>

<p>"On the landing of the first Division, a Royal Salute
is to be fired from the Saluting Battery.</p>

carry out the above order.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Bruce Seton</span>, <em>Major</em>,<br />
<em>Town Major</em>."</p>
</div>

<p>The General Staff of the Garrison testified their admiration
of the gallant conduct of the regiment, by giving a
public banquet to the Officers of the corps; and the
inhabitants of Bombay, including the Civil Authorities,
raised a handsome subscription, to be applied to the
benefit of the sufferers in the regiment, widows and
orphans, by the Campaign in Scinde.</p>

<p>The left wing landed at Panwell on the 16th of May,
and proceeded from thence to Poonah, where it arrived on
the 23rd of May. The right wing and head-quarters
arrived at Poonah, from Bombay, on the 1st of June.</p>

<p>General the Honorable Edward Finch died on the 27th
of October, 1843, and the colonelcy of the regiment was conferred
on Major-General Sir Charles James Napier, K.C.B.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1844</div>

<p>On the 17th and 18th of October, 1844, the regiment
marched from Poonah in wings to Bowree, and on the
19th the whole moved together for Field Service in the
Kolapore districts, where the regiment lost two officers,
and thirty non-commissioned officers and privates, by
cholera.</p>

<p>A portion of the regiment was employed in taking the
north pettah under the walls of the fort of Punalla, on the
27th of November; on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of
November the regiment, under the command of Brevet
Lieut.-Colonel John Poole, was employed in the investment
of <em>Punalla</em> and <em>Pownghur</em>, and on the 1st of December
was at the capture of those forts, the latter of which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
taken by the regiment. During these operations the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> formed part of the third brigade of the
force employed under Major-General Delamotte.</p>

<p>On the 26th of December a wing of the regiment
marched, and joined the first brigade on service in the
Sawunt-Warree district; the other wing remained near
Kolapore.</p>

<p>On the 31st of December, 1844, a wing of the regiment
arrived at Susseedroog from Kolapore, and joined the
first brigade of the Field Force in the Sawunt-Warree
country, and was employed in investing the forts of
Monuhurr and Monsentosh, and participated in all the
operations for driving the enemy out of their stockades
in the densely wooded country between Susseedroog and
the Forts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845</div>

<p>The regiment had several skirmishes with the enemy;
on the 17th of January, 1845, part of the wing descended
the Elephant rock with other troops, and took the village
of Seevapore, in the Concan, close under Fort Monuhurr,
where one man was killed and seven wounded. The whole
of the soldiers were employed, part in the Deccan or
heights above, and part in the Concan close under the
forts, investing them from the 17th to the 26th of January,
during which period the forts were constantly shelled by
the British artillery, the enemy from the forts firing their
great guns and musketry.</p>

<p>On the night of the 26th of January the enemy vacated
the forts unperceived, and escaped through a dense jungle,
leaving the forts in the possession of the Anglo-Indian army.</p>

<p>The wing joined the regiment at Kolapore on the 6th
of February, escorting prisoners taken during the insurrection.
The regiment was employed in doing duty
over about six hundred prisoners <ins class="corr" id="tn-45" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'until its recal'">
until its recall</ins> to Poonah, for which place it marched on the 16th of April, and
arrived on the 2nd of May, 1845.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>A wing of the regiment, consisting of four hundred rank
and file, under the command of Captain Souter, marched
from Poonah for Bombay on the 25th of December, 1845.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1846</div>

<p>The head-quarters of the regiment, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Brandram Boileau, consisting
of five companies, marched from Poonah to Bombay
on the 15th of August, 1846, and joined the wing of the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> at that station. The march was performed
in the middle of the monsoon, in eight days, rain
consequently falling nearly the whole of the way.</p>

<p>The regiment remained together at Bombay, having
six companies at Colaba, and three at Fort George, until
the 14th of November, 1846, when the head-quarters,
with five of the companies which were stationed at Colaba,
were ordered to Poonah, in consequence of fever of a
malarious nature having attacked the men, nearly every
soldier at Colaba having been admitted into hospital in
less than two months; the casualties were very numerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1847<br />1848</div>

<p>The left wing, consisting of four companies, marched
from Bombay on the 12th of January, 1847, and arrived
at Poonah on the 21st of January. During the year
1848 the regiment continued to be stationed at Poonah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1849</div>

<p>On the 25th of January, 1849, the regiment proceeded
to Bombay, and was subsequently stationed at Colaba.
The left wing, consisting of four companies, embarked for
Kurrachee on the 24th of January.</p>

<p>In June, 1849, the period to which the Record has
been extended, the regiment remained at Colaba, and
consisted of fifty-three serjeants, nineteen drummers, and
1042 rank and file, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Sydney John Cotton, Lieutenant-Colonel Boileau
being in command of the Poonah brigade.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Beloochee Standard, represented in the engraving, was
taken at the Battle of <em>Meeanee</em>, on the 17th of February, 1843,
by Private James O'Neill of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment,
as narrated at <a href="#Page_35">page 35</a> of the Historical Record. The Standard
is triangular; the longest side is about seven feet in
length, and the other sides measure each about five feet. The
Staff is nine feet in length.</p>

<p>The Standards captured at the Battle of <em>Hyderabad</em>, on the
24th of March, 1843, were of a similar rude description, and do
not afford a just idea of the Army which they may be supposed
to have led on. No person, on viewing these Trophies, would
suppose the Beloochee Army, to which they belonged, to have
been composed of men so gallant and so formidable; so well
armed, and so expert in the use of their arms, as the Scindian
troops proved themselves in these battles.</p>

<p>"On one of those long marches, which were almost continual, the
Twenty-fifth Sepoys, being nearly maddened by thirst and heat,
saw one of their water-carriers approaching with full skins of water;
they rushed towards him in crowds, tearing away the skins and
struggling together, with loud cries of Water! Water! At that
moment, some half-dozen straggling soldiers of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
came up, apparently exhausted, and asked for some. At once the
generous Indians withheld their hands from the skins, forgot their
own sufferings, and gave the fainting Europeans to drink; then
they all moved on, the Sepoys carrying the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> men's
muskets for them, patting them on the shoulders, and encouraging
them to hold out. It was in vain; they did so for a short time,
but soon fell. It was then discovered that these noble fellows
were all wounded, some deeply, but thinking there was to be
another fight, they had concealed their hurts, and forced nature to
sustain the loss of blood, the pain of wounds, the burning sun,
the long marches, and the sandy desert, that their last moments
might be given to their country on another field of battle!"</p>

measures of the court, and evinced a strong attachment to
the protestant religion. One day (says Bishop Burnet) the
King gave the <span class="smcap">Duke of Norfolk</span> the sword of state to
carry with him to the Popish chapel, which he carried as far
as the door and then stopped, not being willing to enter the
chapel. The King said, "My Lord, your father would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
gone farther;" to which the Duke answered,&mdash;"Your
Majesty's father was the better man, and he would not
have gone so far." His Grace resigned his regiment, and
joined in the invitation to the <span class="smcap">Prince of Orange</span>. When
the Prince landed, the <span class="smcap">Duke of Norfolk</span> was in London,
and was one of the Peers who petitioned the King for a free
parliament. He afterwards proceeded to his seat in Norfolk,
declared for the Prince of Orange, and brought that and
some of the neighbouring counties into the Prince's interest.
On the elevation of the Prince of Orange to the throne, his
Graced was sworn a member of the privy council; and afterwards
used his interest and influence in raising a corps of infantry,
now the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND REGIMENT</span>, of which he
was appointed colonel in March, 1689; but he resigned his
commission in the same year. He died on the 2nd of April
1701.</p>


<p class="p4 center"><span class="smcap">Sir Henry Bellasis, Kt.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 28th September, 1689.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir Henry Bellasis</span> was educated in strict principles of
loyalty and attachment to monarchical government, and when
a youth he suffered in the royal cause during the usurpation
of Cromwell. Soon after the restoration he was nominated
captain of an independent company in garrison at Hull, of
which fortress the Lord Bellasis (or Belasyse) was appointed
governor; but he resigned, in 1673, in consequence of the
Test Act, he being a Roman Catholic. In the summer of
1674, Sir Henry Bellasis raised a company of musketeers and
pikemen for the service of the United Provinces of the Netherlands,
and was engaged at the siege of Grave in the
autumn of that year. He also served at the siege of Maestricht
in 1676; at the battle of Mont-Cassel in 1677; and in the
following spring he succeeded Colonel Ashley in the command
of a regiment which is now the sixth foot. At the
battle of St. Denis, in 1678, he evinced signal valour and
ability, vying in feats of gallantry with his commanders the
Prince of Orange and the celebrated Earl of Ossory, and was
wounded. During the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
in 1685, he accompanied his regiment to England; and in
1687 circumstances occurred which occasioned him to withdraw
from the Dutch service; but he preserved his attachment
to the Protestant interest and to the Prince of Orange.
In 1689 he succeeded the Duke of Norfolk in the colonelcy
of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment, with which corps he
served in Ireland under the veteran Duke Schomberg. He
served as brigadier-general under King William in 1690;
was at the battle of the Boyne; and at the siege of Limerick,
where he again distinguished himself. In 1691 he acquired
new honours at the siege of Athlone; he also displayed
bravery and judgment at the battle of Aghrim; and on the
reduction of Galway he was appointed governor of that fortress,
and took possession of the town on the 26th of July,
with his own and two other regiments of foot. The rank of
major-general was conferred on this distinguished officer in
April, 1692, and he commanded a brigade under King William
in Flanders, in the autumn of that year. He acquired
additional reputation at the battle of Landen, in 1693; also
in the command of a brigade under King William during the
following campaign; and in October, 1694, his Majesty rewarded
him with the rank of lieut.-general. His meritorious
conduct procured him the favour and confidence of his Sovereign,
by whom he was employed on important services. He
commanded the camp on the Bruges canal, in May, 1695; and
a division of the covering army was placed under his orders
during the siege of Namur. At the close of the campaign he
was appointed president of the general court-martial which
tried the officers who surrendered Dixmude and Deinse to the
enemy, and sentenced Major-General Ellemberg to be shot.
He continued to serve in the Netherlands until the peace of
Ryswick. In 1701 he obtained the colonelcy of the Queen
Dowager's regiment (now second foot) in exchange with
Colonel Selwyn. In 1702 he was second in command of the
British troops in the expedition to Cadiz; and having been
charged with participating in the plunder of Port St. Mary,
he was tried by a court-martial and dismissed the service.
His reputation was thus unfortunately tarnished; but his
crime does not appear to have been considered of a heinous
nature, as he was subsequently elected a member of parliament
for the city of Durham; was appointed by Queen Anne, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
1711, one of the commissioners to inquire into several particulars
respecting the accounts of the army in Spain; and in
June, 1713, he was appointed governor of Berwick. He
died on the 14th of December, 1717.</p>

second foot guards, with which corps he served in Flanders,
and in 1691 King William gave him the colonelcy of the
second foot, vacant by the decease of Lieut.-General Kirke.
He served at the head of his regiment at the battle of Landen
on the 29th of July, 1693, and distinguished himself under
the eye of his sovereign; he also served at the siege of Namur,
in the summer of 1695, and was promoted to the rank of
brigadier-general during the siege. He subsequently commanded
a brigade of infantry in the Netherlands, under King
William III., who nominated him governor of the island of
Jamaica. He exchanged to the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment

<p class="p4 center"><span class="smcap">David Dundas.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 2nd April, 1791.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">David Dundas</span> was one of the most distinguished officers of
the age in which he lived, for his perfect knowledge of the
principles of military tactics. He commenced his military
education at the age of thirteen in the academy at Woolwich,
and at fifteen he assisted in a survey of Scotland; in 1756 he
obtained a commission in the Fifty-sixth regiment. In 1758
he proceeded with the expedition to the coast of France as
an assistant quartermaster-general; and in the following year
obtained the command of a troop in a newly raised regiment
of light dragoons (Eliott's light horse), now the fifteenth, or
King's hussars. He served with his regiment in Germany
in 1760 and 1761; in the following summer he accompanied
an expedition to Cuba, as aide-de-camp to Major-General
Eliott, and was actively employed in the reduction of the
Havannah. After the peace he resumed his post in his
regiment, in which he rose to the rank of major; and, urged
by an ardent desire to acquire a perfect knowledge of every
branch of his profession, he obtained permission to proceed to
the Continent, to observe the practice of the French and
Austrian armies. In 1775 he obtained the lieut.-colonelcy
of the twelfth light dragoons, joined the regiment in Ireland
shortly afterwards, and in 1778 received the appointment of
quartermaster-general in that country. In 1782 he was
removed to the lieut.-colonelcy of the second Irish horse, now
the fifth dragoon guards. In 1785 he again proceeded to the
Continent, attended the exercises of the Prussian troops during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
three summers, and after his return he presented His Majesty
with a detailed account of their evolutions.</p>

<p>Colonel Dundas, having become a proficient tactician, produced,
in 1788, a highly useful work on the principles of military
movements, which became the basis of our army regulations
for field exercises and movements. His abilities obtained
for him the favour and attention of King George III., who
appointed him adjutant-general in Ireland, for the purpose of
introducing his system of tactics into the army of that country.
In 1790 Colonel Dundas was promoted to the rank of major-general.
In 1791 he obtained the colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
foot, and in the same year was placed on the Irish
staff, but he resigned that appointment in 1793 to engage in
service of actual warfare. After the commencement of
hostilities with the French republic, Major-General Dundas
was employed on a military mission to the island of Jersey,
and was subsequently sent to the Continent to confer with the
Duke of York respecting the siege of Dunkirk. From
Flanders he proceeded to Toulon, where he commanded under
Lieut.-General O'Hara, and when the lieut.-general was
taken prisoner, he succeeded to the command of the garrison.
His services there, although he was ultimately obliged to
evacuate the place, called forth the approbation of his Sovereign
and of the British nation. After abandoning Toulon, he
made a descent on Corsica, which island was reduced and
annexed to the British dominions; but shortly afterwards he
received directions to proceed to Flanders, where he arrived
in the spring of 1794, and commanded a brigade of cavalry at
the battle of Tournay on the 22nd of May, 1794. Major-General
Dundas was actively employed in the retreat through
Holland, and the corps under his immediate command gained
considerable advantage over the enemy in two successive
actions near Gelder-Malsen; he highly distinguished himself
also in an attack upon the French post at Thuyl, in December
of the same year. He continued with the British troops in
Germany during the summer of 1795, and in December was
appointed colonel of the seventh light dragoons. After
his return to England he was appointed quartermaster-general
to the army; and he composed the celebrated regulations
for the field exercises and movements for the cavalry,
which were approved by his Royal Highness the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
York, and by King George III., and ordered to be exclusively
adopted throughout the cavalry.</p>

<p>In 1799 Lieut.-General Dundas commanded a division of
the allied army under the Duke of York, in the expedition to
Holland; he distinguished himself in several actions with the
enemy, and was highly commended by His Royal Highness
in his public despatches. In 1801 he was appointed colonel
of the second, or Royal North British dragoons, and was constituted
governor of Fort George. In 1802 he was promoted
to the rank of general; and in the following year, when the
French were preparing to invade England, he was placed in
command of the troops in the southern district, which comprised
the counties of Kent and Sussex. In 1804 he was
appointed governor of the Royal Hospital at Chelsea, and
created a Knight of the Bath. On the 18th of March, 1809,
His Majesty was pleased to confer on this distinguished
veteran the appointment of Commander-in-Chief of the army,
on the resignation of Field-Marshal His Royal Highness the
Duke of York, which appointment he held until the 25th of
May, 1811, when His Royal Highness was re-appointed.
He was also appointed colonel-in-chief of the rifle brigade on
the 31st of August, 1809. He was promoted to the colonelcy
of the King's dragoon guards on the <ins class="corr" id="tn-59" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: '27th of Januuary'">

in December, 1775, and served at Long Island and New
York in 1776, and in the expedition to Pennsylvania in 1777,
when he distinguished himself at the battle of Brandywine,
and was wounded. In October of the same year, he was
placed at the head of a provincial corps, called "The Queen's
Rangers," with the rank of major-commandant, and was promoted
to the rank of lieut.-colonel in 1778. His services
with this corps are spoken of by Lieut.-General Sir Henry
Clinton, in a letter to Lord George Germaine, in the following
terms:&mdash;"Lieut.-Colonel Simcoe has been at the head of a
battalion since October, 1777, and since that time he has
been perpetually with the advance of the army. The history
of the corps under his command is a series of gallant,
skilful, and successful enterprises against the enemy, without
a single reverse. The Queen's Rangers have killed, or
taken, twice their own numbers. Colonel Simcoe himself
has been thrice wounded; and I do not scruple to assert,
that his successes have been no less the fruit of the most extensive
knowledge of his profession which study and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
experience within his reach could give him, than of the
most watchful attention and shining courage." After repeatedly
distinguishing himself in North and South Carolina,
and Virginia, he was included in the capitulation of York
Town, and returned to England in a state of debility from
excessive exertion, &amp;c. In 1790 he was promoted to the
rank of colonel, and in the following year raised a corps of
infantry called the Queen's Rangers, of which he was appointed
colonel on the 1st of September, 1791. He subsequently
proceeded to the West Indies, where he evinced the
same talent, energy, and courage which shone so conspicuously
in the American war. In 1794 he was promoted to the rank
of major-general, and in 1796 to the local rank of lieut.-general
in the island of St. Domingo. In January, 1798, he
was appointed Colonel of the Eighty-first regiment, and was
removed, in June following, to the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span> regiment,
the colonelcy of which corps he retained until his decease in
1806.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 30th October, 1806.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">James Henry Craig</span> was appointed ensign in the thirtieth
foot, in 1763, and served with his regiment at Gibraltar; in
1771 he was promoted to captain in the Forty-seventh regiment,
with which corps he served several campaigns in
America; and in 1777 he was promoted to the majority, and
in 1781 to the lieut.-colonelcy, of the Eighty-second regiment,
from which he was removed, in 1783, to the sixteenth. He
was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1790, and to that of
major-general in 1794; in 1795 he was nominated to the
colonelcy of the Forty-sixth regiment: he was advanced to
the rank of lieut.-general in 1801, and removed to the Eighty-sixth
in 1804. He commanded an expedition to the Mediterranean,
in 1805, with the local rank of general, and the
dignity of a knight of the Bath; the troops under his orders
landed at Naples, and subsequently took possession of the
island of Sicily. In 1806 he was removed to the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>
regiment; and in 1807 he was appointed governor
of Upper and Lower Canada, with the local rank of general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
in America; in 1809 he was removed to the Seventy-eighth
Highlanders. He was also appointed governor of Blackness
Castle. He died on the 12th of January, 1812.</p>


<p class="p4 center"><span class="smcap">The Honorable Edward Finch.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 18th September, 1809.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">In 1778 the <span class="smcap">Honorable Edward Finch</span> was appointed
cornet in the eleventh light dragoons, and in 1779 he was
promoted to a lieutenancy in the Eighty-seventh foot. He
embarked for the West Indies, in January, 1780, and served
there, and in North America, until 1782, when he returned
to England, and was appointed lieutenant and captain in the
second foot guards; in 1792 he was promoted to captain and
lieut.-colonel in the same corps. He served the campaigns
of 1793 and 1794, in Flanders, under His Royal Highness
the Duke of York, and shared in the several actions in which
the foot guards distinguished themselves. In 1796 he was
promoted to the rank of colonel, and in 1799 he commanded
the first battalion of his regiment in the expedition to Holland,
where he served in several actions under Lieut.-General Sir
Ralph Abercromby and His Royal Highness the Duke of
York. He commanded the brigade of light cavalry in the
expedition to Egypt, in 1800, with the rank of brigadier-general,
and was promoted to the rank of major-general, in
January, 1801. After commanding the light cavalry in
Egypt some time, he was placed at the head of a brigade of
infantry, and was honored with the Order of the Crescent
from the Grand Seignior. He commanded a brigade of
foot guards in the expedition to Hanover in 1805; and in
1807 he commanded a brigade at the capture of Copenhagen.
In 1808 he was promoted to the rank of lieut.-general, and
appointed colonel of the Fifty-fourth regiment, and in 1809 he
was removed to the <span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>. He was promoted to
the rank of general in 1819. His decease occurred on the

uniform of the Regiment. Your Glory must be my Glory,
and well I know it will increase, when you have again an opportunity

Bayonet wielded by stronger men, nor were the Royal Colours
of England ever confided to more intrepid Soldiers!</p>

<p>"Many General Officers have been made Colonels of Regiments
that they had formerly commanded, and with whose
glory their own fame is associated; but old Comrades have
passed away,&mdash;to the new men, they are strangers,&mdash;and
nought remains to bind them to their Regiments, but Memory
and Renown! My good fortune has been greater, for
while I rejoice in the past and present honors of my old
Corps, the Fiftieth Regiment, I am, as Colonel of the
<span class="allsmcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, placed among men at whose head I have
so lately fought, and to whose valour I owe so much!!</p>

<p>"Soldiers, we are not men without feeling as <em>pseudo</em> Philosophers
pretend! Obedience, Discipline, War, they deprive
us not of Manly sentiments. I shall always have the strongest
attachment to the corps with whom I have served, and among
the honors won for me by the Army of Scinde, the greatest
is that of being your Colonel!!</p>

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
